#### Storefront Backend Project

#### Summary
> The company's stakeholders have decided that they want to create an online store where their product ideas can be purchased â€“ and they want me and a coworker to build it.
The stakeholders have compiled a list of prerequisites for this online store. My coworker will build the frontend, while I will `provide the backend`, and the requirements have been compiled into a requirements document.
I'll `build the database`, including tables and columns, to meet the data requirements, and then `write a RESTful API` to expose that information to the frontend developer.
In order to be ready for beta testing, my application needs to `have tests`, `secure user information`, and `provide user authentication tokens` that are ready to integrate with the frontend.
